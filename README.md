## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- **SQL Server** - LocalDB, Express, or Developer Edition
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code** with C# extension
- **Git** for version control

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd HCAMiniEHR
   ```

2. **Update Connection String**
   
   The connection string is already configured in `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "EHRConnection": "Server=.;Database=EHR2;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
     }
   }
   ```
   
   Modify if needed for your SQL Server instance.

3. **Restore NuGet Packages**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Apply Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
   
   This creates the `EHR2` database with all tables in the `Healthcare` schema.

5. **Run SQL Scripts (in SSMS)**
   
   Execute the following scripts in order:
   
   a. **Create Trigger** - `SQL/CreateAuditTrigger.sql`
   ```sql
   -- Creates trg_Appointment_Audit trigger
   ```
   
   b. **Create Stored Procedure** - `SQL/CreateAppointmentStoredProc.sql`
   ```sql
   -- Creates usp_CreateAppointment procedure
   ```
   
   c. **Seed Data** - `SQL/SeedData.sql`
   ```sql
   -- Inserts 12 patients, 8 appointments, 8 lab orders
   ```

6. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   
   Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` (or the URL shown in console)

## 🎨 Features

### 1. Patient Management
- **List** all patients with search and pagination
- **Create** new patient records with validation
- **Edit** patient information
- **Delete** patients (with cascade delete warning)
- **View Details** including appointment history

### 2. Appointment Scheduling
- **List** appointments with patient and doctor info
- **Create** appointments using **stored procedure** or EF Core
- **View Details** with associated lab orders
- Filter by status (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled)

### 3. Lab Order Management
- **List** all lab orders with patient and test info
- **Create** lab orders linked to appointments
- **Update Status** (Pending → In Progress → Completed)
- Add test results when completing orders

### 4. LINQ Reports

#### Report 1: Pending Lab Orders
**LINQ Operations:** `Where`, `Include`, `OrderBy`, `Select`
```csharp
_context.LabOrders
    .Include(lo => lo.Appointment)
        .ThenInclude(a => a.Patient)
    .Where(lo => lo.Status == "Pending")
    .OrderBy(lo => lo.OrderDate)
    .Select(lo => new PendingLabOrderReport { ... })
```
Shows all pending lab tests with patient and appointment details.

#### Report 2: Patients Without Follow-Up
**LINQ Operations:** `Where` with `Any`, `Select`, `OrderBy`
```csharp
_context.Patients
    .Where(p => !p.Appointments.Any(a => a.AppointmentDate > today))
    .Select(p => new PatientWithoutFollowUpReport { ... })
    .OrderBy(p => p.PatientName)
```
Identifies patients needing follow-up appointments.

#### Report 3: Appointments by Month
**LINQ Operations:** `GroupBy`, `Select` with aggregations, `OrderByDescending`
```csharp
_context.Appointments
    .GroupBy(a => new { a.AppointmentDate.Year, a.AppointmentDate.Month })
    .Select(g => new AppointmentsByMonthReport {
        TotalAppointments = g.Count(),
        ScheduledCount = g.Count(a => a.Status == "Scheduled"),
        CompletedCount = g.Count(a => a.Status == "Completed"),
        ...
    })
```
Monthly appointment statistics with completion rates.

## 🔧 Design Decisions

### 1. Repository Pattern
**Why?** Separates data access logic from business logic, making the code more testable and maintainable.

**Implementation:**
- Generic `IRepository<T>` interface for common CRUD operations
- `Repository<T>` base class with EF Core implementation
- Service layer (PatientService, etc.) uses repositories

### 2. Healthcare Schema
**Why?** Organizes database objects logically and follows healthcare industry best practices.

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation from other potential schemas (e.g., Security, Billing)
- Easier to manage permissions at schema level
- Professional database organization

### 3. Stored Procedure for Appointments
**Why?** Demonstrates ability to integrate T-SQL with C# and provides performance benefits.

**Advantages:**
- Validation logic in database (patient exists, date not in past)
- Atomic operation with transaction support
- Can be called from multiple applications
- Showcases `ExecuteSqlRaw` with output parameters

**Implementation:**
```csharp
await _context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync(
    "EXEC [Healthcare].[usp_CreateAppointment] @PatientId, ..., @NewAppointmentId OUTPUT",
    parameters);
```

### 4. Audit Trigger
**Why?** Automatic change tracking without application code modifications.

**Trigger Logic:**
- Detects INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Captures old and new values
- Records system user and timestamp
- Demonstrates database-level auditing

### 5. Bootstrap 5 UI
**Why?** Modern, responsive design with minimal custom CSS.

**Features:**
- Card-based dashboard with statistics
- Color-coded status badges
- Bootstrap Icons for visual clarity
- Mobile-responsive layout

## 📊 LINQ Operations Demonstrated

| Operation | Usage | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `Where` | Filtering | Pending lab orders, future appointments |
| `Select` | Projection | Custom DTOs for reports |
| `GroupBy` | Aggregation | Appointments by month |
| `Join` (via Include) | Related data | Lab orders with patients |
| `OrderBy` / `OrderByDescending` | Sorting | All reports |
| `Any` | Existence check | Patients without future appointments |
| `Count` | Aggregation | Statistics in all reports |
| `ThenInclude` | Multi-level joins | Lab orders → Appointments → Patients |

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **CRUD Operations**
   - [ ] Create a new patient
   - [ ] Edit patient information
   - [ ] View patient details with appointments
   - [ ] Delete patient (verify cascade delete)
   - [ ] Create appointment using stored procedure
   - [ ] Create lab order for appointment
   - [ ] Update lab order status to "Completed"

2. **Database Verification (SSMS)**
   ```sql
   -- Verify tables exist
   SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME 
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'Healthcare';
   
   -- Check seed data
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [Healthcare].[Patient];  -- Should be 12
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [Healthcare].[Appointment];  -- Should be 8
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [Healthcare].[LabOrder];  -- Should be 8
   
   -- Test trigger
   UPDATE [Healthcare].[Appointment] 
   SET Status = 'Completed' 
   WHERE AppointmentId = 1;
   
   SELECT * FROM [Healthcare].[AuditLog] 
   ORDER BY ChangedDate DESC;  -- Should show UPDATE entry
   
   -- Test stored procedure
   EXEC [Healthcare].[usp_CreateAppointment] 
       @PatientId = 1,
       @AppointmentDate = '2026-02-15',
       @AppointmentTime = '14:30',
       @DoctorName = 'Dr. Test',
       @Reason = 'Testing SP';
   ```

3. **LINQ Reports**
   - [ ] Navigate to Reports page
   - [ ] Verify "Pending Lab Orders" shows correct data
   - [ ] Verify "Patients Without Follow-Up" identifies patients correctly
   - [ ] Verify "Appointments by Month" aggregates properly
